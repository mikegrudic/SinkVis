#Install amuse first:
pip install amuse-framework --user
pip install amuse-fresco amuse-masc --user
#See https://amusecode.github.io/installation if there are issues


####Outdated instructions for older version
#pip install amuse-sse --user
#Test the installation by running amuse_fresco_test.py (first change the filename variable so tht it points to a valid snapshot)
#If running the test produces errors, try replacing gridify.py in your local amuse install with the version in this folder (location of gridify.py in amuse is ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/amuse/ext/gridify.py )
